                with players and coaches alike eager to kick off the season on a high note. Senior Joshua Phelps says: "I am extremley excited for the season. This year I want to leave<br>
                nothing on the table. We have some unfinished buisness in the conference." This season holds a lot of promise for Atkins' baseball team.<br>
                The players have shown remarkable progress in their training sessions, and the coaching staff is optimistic about the team's chances this year.<br>
                As the days tick down to the season opener, the excitement continues to build. So, mark your calendars for February 26, <br>
                and come out to <b><i>The Desert</i></b> to support the Atkins' baseball team as they embark on what promises to be an exciting season.
